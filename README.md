# IIUMCourseScheduleApp
This is an Android App that scrapes data from the IIUM Course Schedule website and display in neatly fashion.
It requires Internet Connection each time the scrapper is activated (duh).

## What It Does
1. A functioning scraper.
2. Display it in a RecyclerView
3. Nav Bar, but doesn't do much

## What It Doesn't
1. Search Function
2. Fully working Nav Bar
3. Back Button that goes back to Main Activity
4. Database in case for offline use

## What It Should Have
1. A good functioning UI and cohesive UX.

P.S I just learn how to code an app two months ago. Gimme a break, will ya?
